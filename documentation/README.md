# Use Summarization Oct Preview API

## Prerequisites
1. The current version of cURL. 
2. Azure subscription. 
    - Please tell us your Subscription ID first so we can add you to the allowlist, because this is a public gated preview feature. Don't know your Azure Subscription ID? See article for help: https://aka.ms/get-subscription-id
3. Create [Language resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) via Azure portal.
    - Select the Subscription which is added into allowedlist.
    - Select `East US` as region.
    - Select `S` as pricing tier.
    - Create and note down the key and endpoint for later use.

## Features
[Document Abstractive Summarization](#document-abstractive-summarization)

The input is a string of plain text. The output is one or a few sentences. Use this feature to summarize news article, scientific paper, etc.

[Conversation Chapters](#conversation-chapters)

The input is conversation transcript or chat messages. The output is chapter title.

[Conversation Narrative](#conversation-narrative)

The input is also conversation transcript or chat messages. The output is one or a few sentences of summary. Use this feature to create call notes, meeting notes or chat summary.

### Document Abstractive Summarization
1. Copy the command below into a text editor. The BASH example uses the `\` line continuation character. If your console or terminal uses a different line continuation character, use that character.
```
curl -i -X POST https://<your-language-resource-endpoint>/language/analyze-text/jobs?api-version=2022-10-01-preview \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-language-resource-key>" \
-d \

As Chief Technology Officer of Azure AI Cognitive Services, I have been working with a team of amazing scientists and engineers to turn this quest into a reality. In my role, I enjoy a unique perspective in viewing the relationship among three attributes of human cognition: monolingual text (X), audio or visual sensory signals, (Y) and multilingual (Z). At the intersection of all three, there’s magic—what we call XYZ-code as illustrated in Figure 1—a joint representation to create more powerful AI that can speak, hear, see, and understand humans better. We believe XYZ-code will enable us to fulfill our long-term vision: cross-domain transfer learning, spanning modalities and languages. The goal is to have pre-trained models that can jointly learn representations to support a broad range of downstream AI tasks, much in the way humans do today. Over the past five years, we have achieved human performance on benchmarks in conversational speech recognition, machine translation, conversational question answering, machine reading comprehension, and image captioning. These five breakthroughs provided us with strong signals toward our more ambitious aspiration to produce a leap in AI capabilities, achieving multi-sensory and multilingual learning that is closer in line with how humans learn and understand. I believe the joint XYZ-code is a foundational component of this aspiration, if grounded with external knowledge sources in the downstream AI tasks."

2. Make the following changes in the command where needed:
    - Replace the value `your-language-resource-key` with your key.
    - Replace the first part of the request URL `your-language-resource-endpoint` with your endpoint URL.
3. Open a command prompt window (for example: BASH).
4. Paste the command from the text editor into the command prompt window, and then run the command.

5. Get the `operation-location` from the response header. The value will look similar to the following URL:
```
https://<your-language-resource-endpoint>/language/analyze-text/jobs/12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678?api-version=2022-10-01-preview
```
6. To get the results of the request, use the following cURL command. Be sure to replace `<my-job-id>` with the GUID value you received from the previous `operation-location` response header:
```
curl -X GET https://<your-language-resource-endpoint>/language/analyze-text/jobs/<my-job-id>?api-version=2022-10-01-preview \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-language-resource-key>"
